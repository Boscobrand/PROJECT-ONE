# PROJECT ONE: BOMB SQUAD

## **BACKGROUND**

For this first project, we were presented with the opportunity to create a game that would be deployed through our personal GitHub.  We were provided with several options including Flash Cards, Trivia, Spaceman, Tower of Hanoi or Simon.  My selection was to develop a game similar to Simon, the popular game from the 1980's based on pattern recognition, but from a different perspective.

## **BOMB SQUAD: THE GAME**

The concept of Bomb Squad was to increase a level of tension delivered by a normal Simon game, which typically rises at a steady rate.  This game is for players who enjoy a sequencing challenge under pressure (think Simon meets Perfection).  Bomb Squad adds to the experience by asking the player to dismantle a bomb by entering code sequences and matching 15 electronic touchpad patterns in a row, within a rapidly decreasing time limit.  The sounds were chosen to be a little less musical and a little more stress inducing.  Player progress is tracked in a Sequence Status display, all while a countdown clock ticks away to add even more of a challenge to the task.  The game applauds you if you disarm the bomb, and mourns you if you do not.

## **BOMB SQUAD: DEVELOPMENT**

 - The process started with an initial proposal, including the development of user stories to connect with the needs of a player who may be interested in playing this game.  A wireframe of the proposed user interface was also developed.

## **USER STORIES:**

- As a player, I will want to be able to track the sequences on the touchpads.
- As a player, I will want validation that I am activating the correct touchpads.
- As a player, I would like to be engaged with this game with light and sound.
- As a player, I will want to know how many sequences I have remaining to disarm the bomb.
- As a player, I would like to be rewarded with a win condition of some form.



## **BOMB SQUAD: PROJECT MANAGEMENT**

 - Project management tools were used throughout the development period. 
 - First, a timetable for the project was developed in a spreadsheet in order to have a clarity of goals, stretch goals, milestones, and above all to stay on pace.  
 - Adjustments to the plan were made as necessary to stay on focus for delivering against first level MVP Goals agreed upon with the team, and then incorporating the higher silver, and gold level aspirations we had for the game to make the most effective use of our time.


*MVP Goals (Minimum Viable Product)*
 - A functioning Simon product (Gamelogic, touchpads with highlights)
 - Sequence Count and Tracker
 - Effectively accessible/working online
 - Delivery of a win or lose condition (near term Alert/long term GIF)

*Stretch Goals for the Product*
- Countdown Clock
- Introductcory delivery of Modal for story background
- GIF API delivery of a random GIF depicting an explosion
- Advanced Styling (Further CSS enhancement)
- Responsive deployment
- Player Name Entry
- Point System and High Score Earner

Once the project was approved internally, the game was created using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript languages on a MacBook Air.  All three code files were separately validated and PDF files of their validation are included in the accompanying folder on this repo.


## **CURRENT STATUS AND NEXT STEPS:**

- At the time of this writing the Bomb Squad Game has fulfilled 90% of its MVP requirement.  
- An unfortunate chain of Unexpected TypeErrors took over Thursday's schedule, which hampered a full and complete run through of the initial sequencing test. While we planned and anticipated we would run into some challenge during development, there were two primary undefined errors encountered that were very unique and required additional attention to address.
- Most current test has shown exceptional progress and there is optimism that we may resolve the current issue bug by deadline tomorrow.


## **GAME INSTALLATION AND INSTRUCTIONS**

### *Installation*

- This game can be accessed and played remotely, so if you have a browser you have access.
- You can access Bomb Squad here: https://boscobrand.github.io/PROJECT-ONE/

### *Instructions*

**Get familiar with the device:**
 - The countdown screen tells you how much time you have left
 - The sequence status will instruct you when to play, how many code entries you have left to tap in, and what level you are on
 - The DEFUSE button will start your game.

**Play the Game:**
 - Click all touchpads and buttons with your mouse or your finger on your touchscreen or tablet (smartphone version coming soon).
 - The device will lead you through a coded sequence.  Act when you are prompted.
 - You will see the touchpad depress down on the device an hear an accompanying sound.
 - Follow the pattern...or else!
 - Your goal is to clear 15 seqquences to defuse the bomb,
 - You will be alerted if you save the day or...not.

**Good luck! We are all depending on you!**
