revisiting touchpad activation

what was the goal of this step?

- switch the css to activated (classList.add and remove)
- turn on brighter color and eventually sound file
- the function was supposed to access the HTML data-color element and return the tile color
- it was also supposed to access the sound file corresponding to the color
- it would then move through classList to engage the CSS
- then move on to the play function to iterate over the array
