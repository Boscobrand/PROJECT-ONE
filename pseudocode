- eventListeners)

computer must execute first pattern
- randomly generated

player must follow first pattern
-array matching an array? Input by touchpads?

Repeat to (x) times - for game demo purposes say 5-7
- Counter of how many rounds completed - Count after fx completes

start button
- 

Gamelogic
- random assignment of pattern (some kind of random array of numbers)

- record keeping of player interaction to follow pattern (a function 
to iterate/read through and match pattern/numbers)

- breakpoint

revisiting touchpad activation

what was the goal of this step?

- switch the css to activated (classList.add and remove)
- turn on brighter color and eventually sound file
- the function was supposed to access the HTML data-color element and return the tile color
- it was also supposed to access the sound file corresponding to the color
- it would then move through classList to engage the CSS
- then move on to the play function to iterate over the array
- 

- Alt 1: break apart button functionality
    - document.querySelector("#green").addEventListener(click, function(e) {
        playerArr.push("green");
        audio().play()
        check(simonArr,playerArr)
    })
    - need to see where the function(e) is...

- We would be inserting this below the game reset and start of the player turn (including the textContext that generates the level count)...AND...the play function that plays the next round by activating the tiles in the right order, taking the computer's updated sequence array then iterating over it
